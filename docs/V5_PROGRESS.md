# V5 progress tracker

Master prompt: `docs/V5_MASTER.md` (re-read it, and this file, after any context reset; continue from the first item that is not `built`).
Branch: `claude/v5-integration` (from `main`). Nothing is merged to `main`.
Gate per item: `tsc`, `eslint`, `next build` pass. Status: todo / built / debugged.

## Items
| ID | Title | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Tracker + docs, branch, merge PR #17 branch | built | PR #17 branch merged cleanly (no conflicts) |
| 1.2 | Additive migrations | built | 0025–0029 applied to live Supabase (5 migrations: v5_rates_subsidy, v5_flock_lifecycle_enum, v5_flock_lifecycle_tables, v5_costs_purchases, v5_knowledge_library incl. vaccination_schedule) and to a local Postgres |
| 2.1 | HD% display | built | calculated HD large+read-only on production form, new /day page (flock rows + day total); written % small optional |
| 2.2 | Sales page (Aug sales, Sep lines, bird sales) | built | 26 Aug sales shown; 27 Sept sale/local lines listed as "waiting for a rate" (no guessing); bird sales table from flock_movements (4 rows at ₹73 exist live); links to /sales/rates (item 4.1) |
| 2.3 | Navigation: seven sections | built | bottom nav on phones, header links on wide screens, sub-nav per section; Purchases/Medicines/rates/batches/moulting pages arrive with their items |
| 3.1 | Alert rules (owner-decided) | built | rules in `web/lib/analytics/engine.ts` RULES; never-flag filter in `web/lib/neverFlag.ts`; 22 self-tests pass (`node web/scripts/analytics-check.mts <fixtures> --selftest`). Counts on real data: Aug prod-drop 12, mort 4, low-feed 12, egg 9; Sep prod-drop 8, mort 2, low-feed 5, egg 23, missing 1 |
| 3.2 | Placeholder-age flocks: no standard check | built | flocks with placement 2026-01-01 and placement_date_confirmed not true show "age unknown, no standard check"; real flock name (flocks.display_label) everywhere with register label secondary |
| 3.3 | Revenue / cost / profit on analytics | todo | needs 4, 5 |
| 3.4 | Drop `_stage_dp` | todo (blocked) | verified no views/FKs/functions depend on it (100 rows); `DROP TABLE` via Supabase tool times out at 60 s because destructive SQL waits for a confirmation I cannot give. SQL in Needs owner |
| 4.1 | BAFTA rate entry | built | /sales/rates: paste one or many SMS (parser tested, 14 cases, `node web/scripts/rates-check.mts`), preview, date-mismatch stop, replace-warning, subsidy note; screenshot path calls Anthropic vision only if a key is set (NOT tested) |
| 4.2 | Sales rows from ledger lines when rates exist | built | on save, missing sales rows are created for those days (big/small price, amount = eggs × price, both links set, never duplicated); new uploads reuse a rate up to 3 days old else stay unpriced. Tested on local copy of real rows |
| 5.1 | Cost settings | todo | |
| 5.2 | Daily/monthly profit | todo | |
| 6.1 | Knowledge tables + screens | todo | |
| 6.2 | Knowledge importer + sample | todo | |
| 7.1 | Flocks screen / lifecycle | todo | |
| 7.2 | Moulting | todo | |
| 7.3 | Chick batches | todo | |
| 7.4 | Medicines / vaccines | todo | |
| 8.1 | Multi-photo upload queue | todo | |
| 8.2 | Review screen | todo | |
| 8.3 | Date rule | todo | |
| 9.1 | Merge readerV2 into integration branch | todo | |
| 9.2 | Benchmark runs | todo | needs READER_TEST_KEY |
| 9.3 | September test dates | todo | |
| Z | Debug everything | todo | |

## Migrations applied
- 0025_rates_subsidy.sql: daily_egg_rates + rate_per_100, subsidy_paise, original_text, date_in_message, carried_forward
- 0026_flock_lifecycle.sql: flock_stage += 'pre_lay'; flocks + placement_is_chick_date, placement_date_confirmed, chick_batch_id; flock_stage_history; chick_batches; moulting_periods
- 0027_costs_purchases.sql: cost_settings, purchases, diesel_purchases (bird sales reuse flock_movements)
- 0028_knowledge_library.sql: knowledge_documents / _entries / _standards
- 0029_vaccination_schedule.sql: vaccination_schedule (live: applied together with 0028 as v5_knowledge_library)

## Known bugs
(none yet)

## Needs owner
- September BAFTA rates.
- Real placement dates of BAB-8, 9, 10 (placeholder 2026-01-01).
- Exact BAB-5 moulting start date (pre-filled Aug 15 2026, inferred).
- Knowledge content files.
- RLS decision (RLS is OFF on all public tables; not changed).
- Costs not yet given: September electricity, diesel, medicine purchase prices.
- Item 3.4: run in the Supabase SQL editor: `DROP TABLE public._stage_dp;` (owner agreed; verified nothing depends on it; the MCP tool times out waiting for confirmation on destructive SQL).
- First non-zero BAFTA subsidy: confirm effective rate = rate − subsidy/100.

## Could not test
- Rate screenshot reading (vision): needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; code path written, not run.

## Decisions
- `flocks.display_label` IS the real flock name (V5 §2: Sep 9 register shows DB flocks BAB-3,4,5,6,7,10,9,8). My earlier PR #17 note calling it stale was wrong; analytics and the review screen now show it first and the register label as secondary text.
- Moulting: recorded `moulting_periods` rows win; without one the data-based inference (feed ≤25% of own average, HD <80% of before) is used. End of an open period = HD back to 80% of pre-moult after ≥14 days.
- Never-flag filter is read-time only (no rows edited): rows before 2026-09-01, Sep 8/9 feed cells, Sep 15 BAB-3 eggs, Sep 15 breakage 890/390, Sep 20 subtotal, Sep 25 ledger opening, unlabelled ledger lines.
- The old typed `/production` form still exists (needed to correct a day); the new `/day` page is read-only and is the Daily production entry point in the nav.
